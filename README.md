**Reinforcement Learning–Based Hotel Recommendation System**

This repository contains a **Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning project** focused on building an intelligent **hotel recommendation system** using real-world data, database design, and analytics.

It combines:

* Data engineering
* Traditional ML concepts
* Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent design
* Business intelligence visualization

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can **recommend hotels to users intelligently** by learning from data patterns and simulated decision-making using **Reinforcement Learning**.

Instead of only using static prediction models, this project explores how an **RL agent can learn optimal recommendation strategies** over time based on rewards and user-related features.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* Reinforcement Learning (RL)
* Machine Learning fundamentals
* Recommendation systems
* SQL database design
* Data preprocessing
* Business intelligence visualization (Power BI)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   Hotel-related data stored in CSV format.

2. **Database Design**
   SQL scripts used to structure and manage hotel data.

3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**
   Power BI dashboard used to explore:

   * Hotel patterns
   * Trends
   * Customer-related insights

4. **Reinforcement Learning Layer**
   An RL agent is designed to:

   * Observe system states (hotel/user features)
   * Take actions (recommend hotels)
   * Receive rewards based on recommendation quality
   * Improve decisions over time

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a smart hotel recommendation system
* Apply Reinforcement Learning in a practical scenario
* Integrate data engineering + ML + visualization
* Demonstrate how RL can enhance traditional recommendation approaches

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python** (for ML/RL implementation)
* **SQL** (database management)
* **Power BI** (dashboard & visualization)
* **CSV Data Processing**
